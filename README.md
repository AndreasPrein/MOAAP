# MOAAP
The Multi Object Analysis of Atmospheric Phenomena (MOAAP) program identifies and tracks a variaty of atmospheric phenomenon (tropical and extratropical cyclones, antycyclones, atmospheric rivers, fronts, and mesoscale convective systems) as objects in a single freamework. It calculates labeld maps and object characteristics and can be applied to regional and global data. Please read the Wiki (https://github.com/AndreasPrein/MOAAP/wiki) for additional information.

Development of this algorithm was funded by the Research Council of Norway as part of the [FRONTIER](https://www.norceresearch.no/en/projects/the-big-data-and-climate-frontier-making-sense-of-the-explosive-increase-in-climate-data-through-smart-designs-and-big-data-methods) project (project number 301777).
